# This file defines the format understanded by the geo-gig, the format used for the search results shown in the search.html template. The search.html file will consider that every data defined here will exist in an object received there.

# The definition is done by example, and will contain some special characters, described below (most definitions are the same that are already defined for the Python programming language, they are just describer here to avoid any confusion while reading the definition):
# [] -> Encloses a list of elements. And, although in this file the lists will always contain one element, in the real result this lists may contain several elements, or none.
# {} -> Encloses a dictionary. They will contain series of key-value pairs. And all the keys defined here will exist in the final result, always.
# #  -> Just define a comment, will not appear in the real result.
# '' -> Enclose strings, sequences of characters. Those will be keys for the dictionaries.
# <> -> Will enclose the definition of a value.
